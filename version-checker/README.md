# Version Checker
A platform agnostic version checking utility for your cargo crates.

Reads your Cargo.toml and parses out the dependancies, processing their versions and comparing them to a list of known security advisories, as well as their most recent version on [crates.io](https://crates.io)


> ### _Note_
> This project was originally conceived as a utility for [Kalavar]'s developer kit, but has since been extracted into its own program on our [org](https://github.com/KalavarDB).
